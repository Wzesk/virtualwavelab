VirtualWaveLab

Virtual Wave Lab is an open software self- application program created in Matlab® aimed to conduct “hands-on” experiments for teaching water wave mechanics courses at undergraduate and graduate levels. The virtual laboratory consists of three components: (i) an educational component consisting of background material and the description of the experiments mainly based on the water wave mechanics book by Dean and Dalrymple (1991),; (ii) synthetic data, corresponding to different Reynolds-Average Navier-Stokes equations simulations (COBRAS: Lin and Liu, 1998; Losada et al., 2008) of laboratory experiments; and (iii) a Graphical User Interface that allows the user to conduct different experiments, including real-time visualization; and realistic data extracted from virtual (free-surface, pressure, and velocity) sensors measurements which can be exported as binary files. The virtual laboratory is aimed to be used by teachers and students.

The description of the Virtual Wave Lab is presented in Torres-Freyermuth et al. (sub judice, Continental Shelf Research).
